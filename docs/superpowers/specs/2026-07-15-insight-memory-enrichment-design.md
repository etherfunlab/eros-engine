# Insight + memory enrichment: fact `details`, memory `metadata`, Stage-2 slot expansion

**Date:** 2026-07-15
**Status:** Design approved, ready for implementation plan
**Related:** eros-reports `dev-logs/2026-07-15_dreaming_full_design_autobio.md` (design
rationale; §3.1 is this spec's scope), eros-engine-web issue #181 (dreaming-full
constraints)

## Summary

Thicken what the extraction pipeline captures about the user, moving from
"栏位式、简单描述" to "方向式、丰富描述", without touching the pipeline's
mechanics. Three engine changes:

1. **Stage-1 fact `details`** — the per-turn facts extraction may now return a
   sibling `details[]` array carrying per-fact structured metadata (category /
   domain / evidence_type / temporality / persistence / confidence). The engine
   persists it **opaquely** in the existing `companion_insights_events` audit
   stream; it validates structure only, never vocabulary.
2. **Memory `metadata`** — session-end memory extraction may now return the same
   metadata dimensions per memory. A new nullable `metadata JSONB` column on
   `engine.companion_memories` stores them opaquely; the recall path ignores
   them for now.
3. **Stage-2 slot expansion** — six new string slots in the structured insights
   schema (`education`, `family`, `relationship_history`, `social_pattern`,
   `future_plans`, `finance_status`), mirrored into `human_insights`, rendered
   into the 基础画像 chat-prompt section with per-field intimacy tiers, and
   folded into a rebalanced `training_level` weight table.

This is PR A of a two-PR cross-repo effort. PR B (private, eros-engine-web
`infra/engine`) redeploys downstream with the new engine image plus production
prompts that actually emit `details` / `metadata`. The OSS example config ships
reference versions of both prompts so the default deployment exercises the new
paths.

Explicitly **not** in scope: autobio / dreaming-full (dev-log §3.2), any
recall-time use of memory metadata, any A2A-match consumer, engine-side
enforcement of the metadata vocabularies, backfill of historical event rows.

## Background

### Insight extraction today (per-turn, chat post-process)

`extract_insights` (`crates/eros-engine-server/src/pipeline/post_process.rs`)
runs two stages tied by a shared `run_id`:

- **Stage 1 "facts"** — system prompt from `insight_extraction.filter_prompt`
  (downstream-owned config); the engine parses only `{"facts": ["…"]}` via
  `extract_facts_array` and writes the bare string array as the
  `stage='facts'` event payload.
- **Stage 2 "structured"** — hardcoded prompt
  (`extract_structured_insights_prompt` + `COMPANION_INSIGHTS_SCHEMA` in
  `prompt.rs`) fills a fixed 12-slot JSONB, shallow-merged into
  `companion_insights`, then mirrored to the flat `human_insights` row
  (`project_from_insights`), which both the chat prompt's 基础画像 section and
  matching queries read.

**The gap:** if a downstream prompt asks the model for richer per-fact
metadata, the engine parses `facts` and silently drops everything else. The
metadata is generated, paid for, and discarded.

### Memory extraction today (session-end, dreaming sweeper)

`pipeline/dreaming.rs` runs `memory_extraction.filter_prompt` over a finished
session and parses `{"memories": [{content, category}]}` into
`MemoryCandidate { content, category }`. Rows land in
`engine.companion_memories` (content + free-text category + 512-dim embedding).
Same gap: any additional per-memory fields the prompt requests are dropped by
serde.

### The slot schema's origin

The 12 Stage-2 slots were designed for heuristic matching (geo filters, hard
filters, soft scoring). They are adequate for the chat prompt but thin for
matching: nothing captures education, family situation, relationship history,
social patterns, future plans, or financial context. Dev-log §3.1 calls for
adding slots (safe under shallow-merge semantics) while keeping the mechanism
untouched.

## Design principles

- **Engine stores shape, prompts own vocabulary.** The six metadata dimensions
  and their enum values (e.g. `evidence_type: roleplay_expression`) live
  entirely in the prompt text. The engine treats `details` items and memory
  `metadata` as opaque JSON. Downstream can evolve the taxonomy without an
  engine release.
- **Stage-2 keeps its contract.** `facts` (plain strings) drives Stage 2
  exactly as today. The engine does **not** enforce `facts[i] ==
  details[i].content` or equal lengths; a drifting prompt degrades the audit
  stream, never the chat path.
- **No behavior change without the new prompts.** A deployment running the old
  facts-only / memories-only prompts on the new engine sees `details: []` and
  `metadata: NULL` — everything else identical (modulo the A3 schema additions,
  which are themselves inert until facts support them).

## A1. Persist Stage-1 `details` (no migration)

In `extract_facts` (`post_process.rs`), after parsing the reply JSON:

- Read `details` as a sibling of `facts`: `v.get("details")` as an array of
  arbitrary JSON values, cloned as-is. Missing key, non-array, or parse
  weirdness ⇒ `[]`. No per-item validation, no zipping against `facts`.
- Change the `stage='facts'` event payload from the bare facts array to a
  uniform object:

  ```json
  { "facts": ["用户在深圳工作"], "details": [ { "content": "…", "category": "…", … } ] }
  ```

- Status taxonomy unchanged and keyed on `facts` alone: `ok` (facts
  non-empty), `empty` (facts empty — payload still written with whatever
  parsed), `parse_error` (no JSON found — payload stays `NULL`).
- `extract_facts_array`, the early-return on empty facts, Stage 2, and the
  merge/projection chain are untouched.

**Payload-shape compat note:** `companion_insights_events.payload` for
`stage='facts'` changes from JSONB array to JSONB object. Historical rows stay
arrays. Audit/analysis readers (eros-audit) must branch on
`jsonb_typeof(payload)` or read `payload->'facts'` with an array fallback.
This is a one-time, downstream-internal break, accepted in review.

## A2. Memory `metadata` column (migration 0032)

**Migration `0032_companion_memories_metadata.sql`:**

```sql
ALTER TABLE engine.companion_memories
    ADD COLUMN metadata JSONB;
```

Nullable, no default, no index — metadata-only ALTER, no table rewrite.
`NULL` = extractor supplied no metadata (raw-turn rows, relationship rows,
old-prompt deployments).

**Code changes:**

- `MemoryCandidate` (`dreaming.rs`) gains
  `#[serde(flatten)] metadata: serde_json::Map<String, serde_json::Value>` —
  captures every key besides `content` / `category` opaquely (the prompt's
  dimensions today: domain, evidence_type, temporality, persistence,
  confidence; anything future rides along free). Malformed items are still
  skipped by the existing `filter_map` deserialization.
- `MemoryRepo::upsert` (`store/src/memory.rs`) gains a
  `metadata: Option<&serde_json::Value>` parameter, bound into the INSERT.
  The dreaming sweeper passes `Some(obj)` when the flattened map is non-empty,
  else `None`. The raw-turn writer and the relationship-memory writer pass
  `None`.
- `MemoryRow` gains `pub metadata: Option<serde_json::Value>`; the explicit
  SELECT column lists in `memory.rs` add the column. No recall logic reads it
  yet — `search_profile_grouped` still partitions by `category` only.
- **`category` stays a first-class column and keeps its current 5-value
  vocabulary** (fact / preference / event / emotion / relation) because it is
  the recall grouping key (`k_per_category`). The new dimensions deliberately
  exclude `category` from `metadata`.

## A3. Stage-2 slot expansion (migration 0033)

### New slots

Six string slots join the structured schema. Reference intent (exact prompt
prose is an implementation detail; keep the existing "写具体、带细节、禁孤立
标签" discipline and one example each):

| key | 含义 | 例 |
|---|---|---|
| `education` | 学历/学校/专业/在读状态 | 985 本科计算机，毕业五年 |
| `family` | 婚育状况、家庭成员、与家人关系概况 | 独生子，父母在老家，未婚 |
| `relationship_history` | 过往恋情/上一段怎么结束/单身多久 | 去年和异地恋三年的前任分手，之后一直单身 |
| `social_pattern` | 独处/聚会倾向、线上线下社交习惯 | 周末宅家，社交主要靠线上游戏开黑 |
| `future_plans` | 近期目标/人生方向 | 想两年内跳去外企，攒钱在老家买房 |
| `finance_status` | 收入水平/消费习惯/经济压力，仅当用户明确提到 | 月薪两万出头，房贷压力大 |

### Touch points

1. **`COMPANION_INSIGHTS_SCHEMA`** (`prompt.rs`): six field descriptions added.
   填写规范 unchanged (only listed fields, no invention, nested objects
   returned whole).
2. **`companion_insights` JSONB**: free — shallow merge just starts carrying
   the new keys. No migration, no backfill. The daily snapshot table copies
   whole blobs and follows automatically.
3. **Migration `0033_human_insights_profile_expansion.sql`:**

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE engine.human_insights
       ADD COLUMN education            TEXT,
       ADD COLUMN family               TEXT,
       ADD COLUMN relationship_history TEXT,
       ADD COLUMN social_pattern       TEXT,
       ADD COLUMN future_plans         TEXT,
       ADD COLUMN finance_status       TEXT;
   ```

   `ProjectedColumns`, `project_columns`, `HumanInsightsRow`, and the UPSERT
   in `project_from_insights` (16 → 22 binds) extend accordingly. No backfill
   needed: existing users' JSONB lacks the keys, and the mirror is
   full-overwrite on every merge, so columns populate on each user's next
   extracting turn.
4. **Chat-prompt rendering** (`human_insights_to_bullets` in `handlers.rs`,
   plus the test-only parity renderer `insights_to_bullets`). Labels and
   placement in the bullet order, with intimacy tiers:

   | 档 | 渲染顺序 |
   |---|---|
   | Neutral + Full | 城市 → 所在地 → 老家 → 国籍 → 职业 → **教育** → MBTI |
   | Full only | 感情观 → **感情经历** → 兴趣 → 情感需求 → **家庭** → **经济状况** |
   | Neutral + Full | 作息 → **社交模式** → 性格特质 → **未来计划** |

   New labels: 教育 / 感情经历 / 家庭 / 经济状况 / 社交模式 / 未来计划.
   Rationale: `education`/`social_pattern`/`future_plans` are behavioral or
   background facts on par with 职业/作息; `relationship_history`/`family`/
   `finance_status` are intimate and join the Full-only cluster. The
   Full-mode byte-parity contract between the two renderers is preserved
   (both get the same additions). Neutral output for existing users is
   unchanged until the new fields populate.
5. **`WEIGHTS` rebalance** (`store/src/insight.rs`) — 15 weighted fields
   summing to 1.0. The geo trio (location / hometown / nationality) stays
   unweighted, as historically decided:

   | field | old | new | | field | old | new |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | city | .05 | **.04** | | matching_preferences | .10 | **.08** |
   | occupation | .05 | **.04** | | education | — | **.04** |
   | interests | .10 | **.08** | | family | — | **.04** |
   | mbti_guess | .15 | **.10** | | relationship_history | — | **.06** |
   | love_values | .15 | **.12** | | social_pattern | — | **.04** |
   | emotional_needs | .15 | **.12** | | future_plans | — | **.04** |
   | life_rhythm | .10 | **.06** | | finance_status | — | **.02** |
   | personality_traits | .15 | **.12** | | | | |

   **Accepted consequence:** a user who had filled the entire old schema drops
   from `training_level` 1.0 to 0.76 on the next recompute and climbs back as
   new slots fill. Downstream display sees a one-time regression; approved in
   review. `finance_status` is weighted lowest because it is the least often
   disclosed — it must not gate progress.

   The same drop propagates to `lead_score` (`post_process.rs::refresh_lead_score`,
   `training_level × 10`) and the CTA gate (`stream.rs::should_show_cta`,
   `lead_score >= 7.0 && training_level >= 0.4`): legacy users already sitting
   near either threshold may see the CTA suppressed until the new slots fill
   their profile back up. Accepted in the same spirit as the display
   regression above — a one-time dip, not a permanent loss.

## A4. OSS example config refresh (`examples/model_config.toml`)

- **`insight_extraction.filter_prompt`** → a product-neutral **facts+details
  reference prompt**: dual-track output `{"facts": […], "details": […]}` with
  `facts[i] == details[i].content` as a *prompt-level* contract; the six
  dimensions with reference vocabularies (category ×13, domain ×18,
  evidence_type ×4, temporality ×5, persistence ×5, confidence ×3); atomicity
  rules; roleplay boundary rules (RP signals become bounded
  `roleplay_expression` facts — fictional identities/events never become real
  facts); anti-attribution 铁律; faithful recording of sensitive/NSFW content
  without dilution; ≤12 facts; JSON only, `{"facts":[],"details":[]}` when
  empty.
- **`memory_extraction.filter_prompt`** → thickened: content discipline
  (specific, close to the user's words), category vocabulary **unchanged**
  (the 5 recall-grouping values), plus the five shared metadata dimensions
  per item: `{"memories": [{content, category, domain, evidence_type,
  temporality, persistence, confidence}]}`.
- **Budgets:** `insight_extraction.max_tokens` 400 → **1200** (one task block
  serves both stages; Stage 1 now emits details, Stage 2 now fills up to 18
  fields), `memory_extraction.max_tokens` 800 → **1200**. Temperatures stay
  0.2.

The full production prompts (including the reviewed 双轨 insight prompt) ship
downstream in PR B; the OSS reference versions carry the same structure so the
default deployment is self-documenting.

## Testing

- **A1:** details parsed and persisted inside the object payload; absent /
  non-array `details` ⇒ `[]`; parse_error still writes `NULL` payload;
  existing two-events-per-run and empty-facts tests updated to the new payload
  shape; Stage-2 input unaffected by details presence.
- **A2:** migration adds the column (insert + read-back with metadata);
  `MemoryCandidate` flatten captures extra keys and tolerates their absence;
  sweeper writes metadata / writes NULL when the map is empty; raw-turn and
  relationship writers keep writing NULL; recall functions unaffected.
- **A3:** `project_columns` maps the six new keys (and leaves them
  `None`/absent-safe); UPSERT round-trips 22 columns; bullet renderers emit
  new labels in the specified order and tiers, Neutral excludes the three
  intimate additions, Full-mode parity test extended; `WEIGHTS` sums to 1.0
  (add a unit test asserting the sum); `compute_training_level` expectations
  updated (e.g. `training_level_partial` 0.15 → 0.12, full-schema cap test
  now requires all 15 fields).
- **A4:** boot-time config gates already cover non-blank prompts; no new gates.

Standard pre-PR gate: `cargo fmt` / `clippy` / full test suite / openapi
regen check.

## Rollout & sequencing

1. **PR A** (this spec) merges to `dev`, rides the normal release flow; the
   engine image containing it reaches GHCR with the next tag.
2. **PR B** (private): bump the downstream deployment to that image **and**
   ship the production facts+details insight prompt, thickened memory prompt,
   and real max_tokens in `infra/engine`. Boot applies migrations 0032/0033.

Order tolerance: new prompt on an old engine ⇒ details generated then dropped
(wasted tokens, no breakage); new engine on old prompts ⇒ empty
details/NULL metadata (no breakage). Full value requires both, but no
lockstep deploy is needed.
